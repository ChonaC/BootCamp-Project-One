# BootCamp-Project-One

## Description

Create an NFL Dashboard, so when you click on a week you can see the games that are being played in a calendar view, what time the game is at and who the home and away teams are. You can enter the score of the game and key information about any of the players or what happened during the game. All the information will save to local storage, so you can go back and look at the information you entered on the past games and update the information. You can also enter the city a game is occurring and view the weather, so you can gain further information about how the game might go.
